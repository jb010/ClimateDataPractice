# DataViz&Analysis2022

### A series of sessions in R using ggplot to create visualisations

Since graduating my master's in Mathematics and Philosophy, I started learning R using free online resources in 2021 in my spare time. I also learned postgreSQL around this time.

In November 2021 I went travelling in South America and now, returned, I will be building a portfolio of projects here as I apply for data analysis roles. As I was travelling for several months I am a little rusty - more recent sessions will no doubt be more efficient with cleaner analysis.

Please contact me for any feedback or opportunities!
